# RPy-Servo-Interface

A Python library to simplify the use of servos in RaspberryPi

Requires pigpio

This inferface was created to simplify the pigpio inteface, it is quite simple at the moment, but it manages thoe pigpio initialization and fixes the arbitrary servo angles of 500-2500 to 0-1000.

This is still a work in progress, feel free to contribute!
